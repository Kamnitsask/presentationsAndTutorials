Deep Learning on the Analysis of Radiological Images
=====================================================

Tutorial presented in the conference: [Medical Image Understanding and Analysis 2017, Edinburgh, UK](https://miua2017.wordpress.com/programme/)

## Summary

Deep learning is the branch of machine learning that explores the use of artificial neural networks for learning higher-level representations of the data, in a task-dependent and data-driven manner. This allows them to automatically learn to detect highly complex and most suitable features for accomplishing the given task. The power of the learnt features, in combination with the high capacity of these models has led to rapid advances in various fields, among which medical imaging.

The rapid developments and large amount of new literature may be overwhelming when first entering the field of deep learning. In this tutorial we will try to provide intuitions about components, functions and behaviour of the networks. We will focus on convolutional neural networks, and starting from a basic classifier, we will quickly focus on the case of segmentation networks, for their popularity and use in the biomedical field. We will discuss alongside popular state of the art methods, to provide a better understanding of the core design choices that make high performing systems. Finally, we will discuss practical aspects and considerations for applying these methods.
